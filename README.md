# space-raid
This repository will contain most of the code I wrote for my simple python game which I like to call "Space Raid".

I used to play a game called "River Raid" on atari 2600 as a kid. So I was very interested in making a similar game using my programming knowledge.

Making this game took me around 100 hours, and it is a development of a simple 2-hour long practice in the book "Python Crash Course" which I completed when I was
reading the book a year ago. During this time I spent many hours reading documentations, asking questions online and on Stack Overflow, re-reading
what I had learnt earlier, and trying to fix the problems that arose after each modification to the game.


The file "alien invasion" contains the game's main loop and most important parts of the code.

The file called "game functions" contains the bulk of the code I wrote for this game.

To make this game I also used pygame.

I havn't added the music, font, and image files to this repository.

Near the end of making this game I realized each time I'd come close to finishing up the project, a new idea would pop up in my head which took a few hours to fully
implement into the game. Thus after a certain moment I decided not to follow up on my ideas anymore because it might've forced me to spend a few hundred hours more
on the project. Yet I'm quite happy with the end result.

A few of the game's details:

-It has 5 background songs that play randomly.

-Aliens shoot exactly when you shoot, which makes the game a little more interesting.

-Menu has its own unique background music.

-As you progress aliens get faster and you earn more points with each correct shot.

-If you make contact with aliens or they reach the bottom of the screen you lose a life.
